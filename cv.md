### About Me
I am a design engineer in aviation. Every day I face difficult and interesting tasks. Every day I learn something new. I know how to communicate with people and work in a team, because every day I have to solve issues with different departments. But it seems to me that this is not what I want to devote my life to. Airplanes bring a lot of benefits to people, but now much more can be done through writing code, through creating applications and websites. Working in aviation has taught me care and accuracy, the ability to sort out a complex issue in a short time and learn the necessary skills. I really want to become a developer and help people.
